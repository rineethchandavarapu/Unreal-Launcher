   - `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes
   - `docs/<short-description>` for documentation only
3. Make your changes. Run these before committing:

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode — no `any`, no `require()`
- Functional React components with hooks only
- All colors via CSS variables (`var(--color-*)`) — no hardcoded hex values
- Lucide React for icons, Framer Motion for animations
- Keep the license header at the top of every source file intact
